-- Subqueries!!!
-- Subquery - A query within a query

-- Example: Which films have exactly 12 actors in it

-- Step 1. Find the film_ids from the film_actor table that have a count of 12
SELECT film_id, COUNT(*)
FROM film_actor
GROUP BY film_id
HAVING COUNT(*) = 12;

--film_id|
-- ------+
--    529|
--    802|
--     34|
--    892|
--    414|
--    517|

-- Step 2. Query the film table for films that match those IDS
SELECT *
FROM film
WHERE film_id IN (
	529,
	802,
	34,
	892,
	414,
	517
);


-- Put the two steps together into a subquery
-- The query that we want to execute first is the subquery
-- ** Subquery must return only ONE column **      *unless used in a FROM clause
SELECT *

-- Use subqueries for calculations
-- Find all of the payments that are more than the average payment

SELECT *
FROM payment p 
WHERE amount > (
	SELECT AVG(amount)
	FROM payment
);



-- Subqueries with the FROM clause
-- *Subquery in a FROM must be in parenteses - alias optional (as of Postgresql 16)*

-- Find the average number of rentals per customer

-- Step 1. Get the count for each customer
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS num_rentals
FROM rental
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Step 2. Use the temp table from step 1 as the table to find the average via subquery
SELECT AVG(num_rentals)
FROM (
	SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS num_rentals
	FROM rental
	GROUP BY customer_id
) AS customer_rental_totals;


-- Other DQL clauses still work
SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS num_rentals
	FROM rental
	GROUP BY customer_id
)
WHERE num_rentals > 40
ORDER BY num_rentals;


-- Subqueries can also be used in DML statements

-- setup -> add loyalty_member column with Boolean datatype

-- Set the loyalty_member column to False for all customers
UPDATE customer

-- Step 1. Find all the customer IDs of those customer who have rented 25+ films
SELECT customer_id

-- Step 2. Make an update statement and update all customers with those IDs
UPDATE customer
